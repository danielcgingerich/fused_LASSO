# fused LASSO using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
Few R packages exist with flexible implementations of the fused LASSO. Here, I showcase my implementation of the fused LASSO for discovering differential partial correlations. Specifically, given a response $Y = [Y_1, Y_2]^T$ and a matrix of predictors $X$, w
