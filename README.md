# fused LASSO using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
Few R packages exist with flexible implementations of the fused LASSO. Here, I showcase my implementation of the fused LASSO for discovering differential partial correlations. For example, consider the gene expression of treatment (1) versus control (0) groups. Here, we have a response vector $Y = [Y_1, Y_0]$. The design matrix is $\text{BlockDiag}(X_1, X_0)$.  In this setting, we essentially run two separate regressions, as the beta coefficients are paired yet unconstrained. The fused LASSO imposes both a penalty on the beta coefficients, and the differences between beta coefficients of corresponding variables. This is appropriate in the situation where we want to compare the associations of predictor variables across groups without sacrificing power by splitting groups in two.
